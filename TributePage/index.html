              Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January
              1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and
              political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
              successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He
              inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
              The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'),
              first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used
              throughout the world. <br /><br />
              Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi
              trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to
              the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in
              India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he
              moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a
              lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was
              here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent
              resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he
              returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers,
              and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and
              discrimination.

              Gandhi is noted as the greatest figure of the successful Indian
              independence movement against the British rule. He is also hailed
              as the greatest figure of modern
              India.[260][261][262][263][264][265] American historian Stanley
              Wolpert described Gandhi as "India's greatest revolutionary
              nationalist leader" and the greatest Indian since the Buddha.[266]
              In 1999, Gandhi was named "Asian of the century" by Asiaweek.[267]
              In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the
              millennium.[268][269] <br /><br />The word Mahatma, while often
              mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the
              Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning
              Soul).[270][271] He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title
              "Mahatma" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall,
              Durban.[272][273] Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the
              title to Gandhi by 1915.[274][d] In his autobiography, Gandhi
              nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was
              often pained by it.[277][278][279] <br /><br />Innumerable
              streets, roads and localities in India are named after Gandhi.
              These include M.G.Road (the main street of a number of Indian
              cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Kanpur,
              Gangtok and Indore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and
              Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's
              birthplace).[280]
